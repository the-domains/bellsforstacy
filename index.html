Some investigating led me to the already assumed conclusion that the lovely shutter on my lovely NIKON D7000 had - after roughly 300,000 actuations - died. This was not it's first threat
    to leave us. There were other issues I had worked through. There was the time Lewis left it on an airplane. And that time (which was about a year ago to the day) whilst I was mentally calculating how I could afford to replace it whilst being on vacation
    (already a budgeting enterprise) - Lewis was talking about mirrorless cameras. I was (probably angrily) throwing that idea off because mirrorless - BAH - everyone knows DSLR's are the best. So thus. Seed. Planted. When the camera died Lewis asked
    I investigate again. Compare mirrorless and their benefits to the DSLRs and come to a conclusion. I (probably angrily) defended my blessed DSLRs and looked up how much a straight replacement body would be and then looked up how much the newer (but
    still later) model would be. In the end, I went to the store by myself. And I picked them up and took pictures, and asked questions and, in the end, I ended up with the mirrorless. Why? Well. Because it's so much lighter and smaller. Now obviously
    this depends on which lens you have on. I have a 24-240 and it's huge so that's not a big sell feature there. But with the 50mm lens on it's much more manageable. I don't know. We're feeling each other out. It has a lot of perks that I like. The biggest
    down side I'm having is just getting to know it. The LCD screen is easier to see but it isn't true to what they look on screen / printed. That was true of my last as well but I was so familiar I knew how to compensate. It will take time. I still have
    my beloved NIKON. I may fix it yet. But. Till then. The introductions continue.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="14"><!-- react-empty: 15 --></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumn-7de04793-95a1-444e-a5b0-f79a2c95df76" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="16"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="17"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ms-w-50p" data-reactid="18"><a class=" " href="here-is-another-post-stacy-has-not-touched-the-new-website" data-reactid="19"><div class="Cover ov-h " data-reactid="20"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="21"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/36328e4db4ce20a70ec17df8069cd4a5/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff0909984-8141-4bd2-a4ff-320fb45e9ff7.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:73.14453125% 88.73697916666666%;" data-reactid="22"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/89c9610390861118a8dee7dd42bb2135/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff0909984-8141-4bd2-a4ff-320fb45e9ff7.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:73.14453125% 88.73697916666666%;" data-reactid="23"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e65d71b6cb3b73b86d82a5f22d61f5ce/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff0909984-8141-4bd2-a4ff-320fb45e9ff7.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:73.14453125% 88.73697916666666%;" data-reactid="24"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/aa24deed08c072c99d5ae497096aa3a7/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff0909984-8141-4bd2-a4ff-320fb45e9ff7.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:73.14453125% 88.73697916666666%;" data-reactid="25"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="3264" data-height="2448" data-ratio="1.3333333333333333" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/36328e4db4ce20a70ec17df8069cd4a5/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff0909984-8141-4bd2-a4ff-320fb45e9ff7.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:73.14453125% 88.73697916666666%;" data-reactid="26"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><!-- react-empty: 29 --><!-- react-empty: 30 --><!-- react-empty: 31 --><!-- react-empty: 32 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="33"><p>Here is another post.  Stacy has not touched the new website yet.  when she does, I think she will find it to be a bit odd, but interesting enough to test out!</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_Column-be3e7eba-347b-4699-973a-a849a90593b2" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="34"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="35"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="36"><!-- react-empty: 37 --><!-- react-empty: 38 --><!-- react-empty: 39 --><!-- react-empty: 40 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="41"><p>post # 2 </p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="42"><p>Stacy may not like this new website, until she uses it for a few days...she is a muller.</p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="43"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="44"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="45"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="46"><span data-reactid="47"><!-- react-empty: 48 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="49"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="50">BellsForStacy</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="51"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="52"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="53"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

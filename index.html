Some investigating led me to the already assumed conclusion that the lovely shutter on my lovely NIKON D7000 had - after roughly 300,000 actuations - died.

This was not it's first threat to leave us.  There were other issues I had worked through.  There was the time Lewis left it on an airplane.  And that time (which was about a year ago to the day) whilst I was mentally calculating how I could afford to replace it whilst being on vacation (already a budgeting enterprise) - Lewis was talking about mirrorless cameras.  I was (probably angrily) throwing that idea off because mirrorless - BAH - everyone knows DSLR's are the best.

So thus.  Seed.  Planted.

When the camera died Lewis asked I investigate again.  Compare mirrorless and their benefits to the DSLRs and come to a conclusion.  I (probably angrily) defended my blessed DSLRs and looked up how much a straight replacement body would be and then looked up how much the newer (but still later) model would be.

In the end, I went to the store by myself.  And I picked them up and took pictures, and asked questions and, in the end, I ended up with the mirrorless.

Why? 

Well.  Because it's so much lighter and smaller.  Now obviously this depends on which lens you have on.  I have a 24-240 and it's huge so that's not a big sell feature there.  But with the 50mm lens on it's much more manageable.

I don't know.  We're feeling each other out.  It has a lot of perks that I like.  The biggest down side I'm having is just getting to know it.  The LCD screen is easier to see but it isn't true to what they look on screen / printed.  That was true of my last as well but I was so familiar I knew how to compensate.  It will take time.

I still have my beloved NIKON.  I may fix it yet.  But.  Till then.  The introductions continue.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="15"><!-- react-empty: 16 --></div></section><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-1 d-f a-i-stretch no-padding title-size-large color-bg color-title section-bgcover-w  text-align-left  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="17"><div class="Component p-1 ls-p-8 d-f fx-c j-c-between pos-r w-100p a-i-start t-a-l" data-reactid="18"><div class="Bg op-30" data-reactid="19"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="20"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="21"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c582aaa96a9a8012674113df61a1aee3/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff0909984-8141-4bd2-a4ff-320fb45e9ff7.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:73.14453125% 88.73697916666666%;" data-reactid="22"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ca787130a3ae0976bf1e7a9b9da03ca6/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff0909984-8141-4bd2-a4ff-320fb45e9ff7.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:73.14453125% 88.73697916666666%;" data-reactid="23"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9c475cb1a170c98e2f67fa9becbe24f6/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff0909984-8141-4bd2-a4ff-320fb45e9ff7.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:73.14453125% 88.73697916666666%;" data-reactid="24"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1e11b3c0311e02145835debd8ff61b0b/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff0909984-8141-4bd2-a4ff-320fb45e9ff7.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:73.14453125% 88.73697916666666%;" data-reactid="25"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="3264" data-height="2448" data-ratio="1.3333333333333333" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c582aaa96a9a8012674113df61a1aee3/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff0909984-8141-4bd2-a4ff-320fb45e9ff7.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:73.14453125% 88.73697916666666%;" data-reactid="26"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 ls-p-2 max-w-560px color-title h-100p" data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><!-- react-empty: 29 --><!-- react-empty: 30 --><!-- react-empty: 31 --><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="32"><p data-reactid="33">Here is another post.  Stacy has not touched the new website yet.  when she does, I think she will find it to be a bit odd, but interesting enough to test out!</p></div></div></div></section><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="34"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="35"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="36"><!-- react-empty: 37 --><!-- react-empty: 38 --><!-- react-empty: 39 --><!-- react-empty: 40 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="41"><p data-reactid="42">post # 2 </p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="43"><p data-reactid="44">Stacy may not like this new website, until she uses it for a few days...she is a muller.</p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="45"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="46"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="47"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="48"><span data-reactid="49"><!-- react-empty: 50 --><h2 data-reactid="51"><a data-reactid="52">BellsForStacy</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="53"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="55"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="56"></div></section></div></div>

serif"],"description":"Roboto is an open-source, grotesque sans-serif typeface designed by Christian Robertson in 2011 and released through Google. Despite being accused of being a “frankenfont” mashup of DIN and Helvetica, I’m personally quite fond of Roboto. I think it renders crisply on screens and is very legible, even at smaller sizes. Roboto is the default font used in Google Maps and Google+."}},"styles":"html { font-family: '-apple-system', '.SFNSText-Regular', 'San Francisco', 'Roboto', 'Segoe UI', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida
